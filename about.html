    <h3 class="about-text">SYNOPSIS</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">This is a coming-of-age story about two girls realizing they have agency over the choices they make after years of letting life, boys, drugs, and Tess’s cult past bend them over a table.<br><br>

      It is 1984, and a series of unfortunate events send the girls spiraling toward rock bottom at an inextinguishable pace, forcing them face to face with reality for the first time in their lives, all the way down in the pits of being $5,000 in debt (approx. equivalent to $15,287.34 in 2025). 

      <br><br>

      A stroke of grace leads them to the office of Rabbi Adelstein, a wise Bostonian lesbian who came of age herself at the dawn of the United States Gay rights movement. She asks Tess and Riley  to consider what on earth they’ve been doing with their lives, and whether or not they’d like to remain asleep at the wheel.  <br><br>

No, say the girls. We’d like to fuck the world back. <br><br>

Thus marks the start of the girls’ quest for world domination, as they embark on a journey to learn how to harness the full potential of their power.

  <h3 class="about-text">OTHER INFORMATION</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">It’s really funny and good! Also, Tess is an Accessibility Coordinator and would ideally like to have at least one performance be as accessible as can be (touch tour, audio description, captioning). We are in the process of creating the audio description and captioning and would love to see what else is possible to make the show accessible for a wider audience.
